a) What is the difference between Internal Stroage and External Storage?

Internal memory is the memory available to us for installing our applications (the operating system ones) and data. 
Applications are installed in this storage and our personal data such as text messages, contact lists, our email settings 
are stored on this. This is considered to be quite sensitive information and this is not accessible to us.

Whereas external memory is the external storage capacity of our phone which is accessible to us. It is the storage which can be 
removed easily by us (our memory card) and can be used for storing pictures, music, videos. 

In terms of security, Internal memory is more secure because anyone can remove our external storage and can access its files which is not possible 
in case of internal storage.
In terms of reliability, when an app is uninstalled, its app data stored in Internal Storage is lost, whereas, if the data is stored in 
external storage, it is not lost when the app is uninstalled.

b) For how long the data resides in the cache?
As long as the user doesn't clear cache or the device doesn't run out of memory cached data resides inside the phone or internal memory.

c) What are the critical permissions and Normal permissions? What are the examples of each?
If an app declares in its manifest that it needs a normal permission, the system automatically grants the app that
permission at install time. The system does not prompt the user to grant normal permissions, and users cannot revoke 
these permissions.
Examples Check and change data connection: Include network state, Wi-Fi State, Bluetooth, Internet, etc.

Whereas in case of critical permissions the system prompts the user to grant these permissions at run time.
Example for accessing locations in Ola or Uber app.
